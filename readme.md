# Songs Setlist Creation

https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/songs-worship-setlist-heroku/songs

##  The necesity
At out local church I'm part of the worship team. One of the issues we face each week is coming up with a song setlist for sunday service. coming up with a setlist is not as easy as it seems. keeping track of the songs we played during month is difficult as some songs tend to burn out because we played them too much. We spend to much time coming up with setlist during practice.


##  Solution
1 create a database of the songs we play
2 use the database to create curated setslists that we can use though out the whole year.
3. elminiate last minute planning during rehersal time.about-contact
4. avoid brain burnout coming up with setlists on the spot

## technologies used

mongoose, mongo, express, react and jsx. material-kit css

## Issues
- the majority of the issues were syntax.
- Arthur helped me figure out how to pull youtube videos by using the youtube video id
- I forgot to Init caps my name files for react

## Future
- I want to be able to make playlists using the song database
- I want to be able to sort songs by themes and type so we can pull songs for christmas, Easter and special moments.

## Help From Peers
- Michael Dichelo helped me figure out what to do as a project. He asked me what type of hobbies do I have and to make an app around my hobbies.

- Bruno Helped me with the json seed data.
